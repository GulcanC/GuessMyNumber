# :question: Guess My Number - JavaScript Game

### The Goal of This Project
The goal of this project is to guess a secret number which is between 1 and 20. There is an input that we can write a number. When we click the "check" button we will get
a message at the right side. The message depends on our number and it will say "Too low", "Too high" or "Correct number".

The score starts with a score of 20 and after one failed guess it will decrease to 19. So basically after each guess that we fail, the score decrease by one. 

If we want to play again, we can simply click "Again" button and it all resets everything except for "Highscore". "Highscore" is another feature of this small application that 
shows our Higher score. 

### DOM Manipulation
DOM stands Document Object Model, it is basically, a structured representation of HTML documents. It allows JS to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them. DOM is 
basically a connection point between HTML document and JS code. DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon as the HTML page loads.
